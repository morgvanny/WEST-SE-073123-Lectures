# ðŸ“š Review:
# Python environment set up
# Python debugging tools
# Python datatypes

# ðŸš¨ To enable ipdb debugging, first import "ipdb"
import ipdb

# 1. âœ… Create a condition to check a pet's mood
# If "pet_mood" is "Hungry!", "Rose needs to be fed."
# If "pet_mood" is "Rowdy!", "Rose needs a walk."
# In all other cases, "Rose is all good."

# Note => Feel free to set your own values for "pet_mood" to view various outputs.

pet_mood = "Rowdy!"
pet_name = "Rose"

# if pet_mood == "Hungry!":
#     print("Rose needs to be fed.")
# elif pet_mood == "Rowdy!":
#     print("Rose needs a walk.")
# else:
#     print("Rose is all good.")


# ipdb.set_trace()

# print(pet_mood)
# print(pet_name)

# 2. âœ… Create a ternary operator using "pet_mood" as a condition:
# If pet_food is "Hungry!" => "Rose needs to be fed."
# In all other cases => "Rose is all good."

# print("Rose needs to be fed.") if pet_mood == "Hungry!" else print(
#     "Rose is all good.")

# 3. âœ… Create a function (say_hello) that returns the string "Hello, world!"
# Test invocation of "say_hello" in ipdb using "say_hello()"
# say_hello() => "Hello, world!"


def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")


# say_hello()
# say_hello()
# say_hello()
# 4. âœ… Create a function (pet_greeting) that will return a string with interpolated pet's name
# Test invocation of "pet_greeting" in ipdb using "pet_greeting()"
# pet_greeting("Rose") => "Rose says hello!"
# pet_greeting("Spot") => "Spot says hello!"


def pet_greeting(pet_name="Unknown"):
    print(f"{pet_name} says hello!")


# pet_greeting()
# pet_greeting("Rose")
# pet_greeting("Spot")

# 5. âœ… Move conditional logic from Deliverable 1 into a function (pet_status) so that we may use it with different pets / moods
# Test invocation of "pet_status" in ipdb using "pet_status(pet_name, pet_mood)"
# pet_status("Rose", "Hungry!") => "Rose needs to be fed."
# pet_greeting("Spot", "Rowdy!") => "Spot needs a walk."
# pet_greeting("Bud", "Relaxed") => "Bud is all good."

def pet_status(pet_name, pet_mood):
    if pet_mood == "Hungry!":
        print(f"{pet_name} needs to be fed.")
    elif pet_mood == "Rowdy!":
        print(f"{pet_name} needs a walk.")
    else:
        print(f"{pet_name} is all good.")


pet_status("Rose", "Hungry!")
pet_status("Spot", "Rowdy!")
pet_status("Bud", "Relaxed")


# Take a moment to note that "pet_name" and "pet_mood" parameters are within Local Scope and take priority over "pet_name" and "pet_mood"
# in Global Scope.

# 6. âœ… Create a function (pet_birthday) that will increment a pet's age up by 1. Use try / except to handle errors.
# If our function is given an incorrect datatype, it should handle the TypeError exception and alert the user
# pet_birthday(10) => "Happy Birthday! Your pet is now 11."
# pet_birthday("oops") => "Type Error Occurred"

def pet_birthday(age):
    try:
        print(f"Happy Birthday! Your pet is now {age + 1}.")
    except TypeError:
        print("A type error occurred")
    except NameError:
        print("A name error occurred")


pet_birthday(10)
pet_birthday("oops")
pet_birthday(15)
