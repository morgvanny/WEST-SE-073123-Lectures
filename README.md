# WEST-SE-073123-Lectures

The main branch will have starter code for lectures. The solution branch will have the completed code after the lecture.
I recommend cloning this repository, and you'll frequently need to `git pull` from the main branch to get starter code for new lectures, and from the solution branch to get new completed code. You can also do `git pull --all` to merge both remote branches in at once.

When coding along or making any changes, I recommend creating a new branch with `git checkout -b some-branch-name` and make your own changes and commits there. When you pull new code into your main branch, branches you've created won't have that - so you can either a) create a new branch off of the main branch every time, or b) from within your branch, run `git merge main` to pull the new code into it. Note: you won't be able `git push` any commits in this repository - your branches and commits will only be saved on your local machine. If you want it on github, you can create a fork from this repository and do whatever you'd like with it - but that will complicate your process for pulling in new commits I make throughout the program, since you'd have to pull from the original rather than just your fork.

If you run into problems with any of this, let me know and I'll help you troubleshoot!
